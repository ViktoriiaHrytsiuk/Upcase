# Ruby Challenges / Analyzing Shakespeare

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Ruby Challenges](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/ruby-challenges) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

Difficulty: **Easy, but requires isolating an external service during testing.**

As a Shakespeare buff, statistics junkie, and Unix lover, Ben finds himself wanting a command-line tool for analyzing Macbeth.

Write a command-line program that prints the number of lines spoken by each character in the play.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/analyzing-shakespeare.git
    cd analyzing-shakespeare
    bin/setup

Sample usage/output (using made-up numbers):

    $ ruby macbeth_analyzer.rb
      543 Macbeth
      345 Banquo
      220 Duncan
      (etc.)

You can find an XML-encoded version of Macbeth here: http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/examples/shakespeare/macbeth.xml. Your program should download and parse this file at runtime.

Your solution must be tested, preferably via TDD. Running your tests _should not_ download the play from the ibiblio.org server.

Note: some lines are attributed to a speaker called "ALL". Your program should ignore these.
